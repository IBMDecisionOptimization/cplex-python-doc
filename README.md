# IBM® CPLEX Python API Reference Documentation

The CPLEX Python API is a Python package named cplex that allows the Callable Library to be accessed from the Python programming language. It is equally suitable for interactive use through the Python interpreter or for writing scripts or full-fledged applications.

For users of Python, CPLEX offers both a Python application programming interface (API) documented in this reference manual, as well as IBM Decision Optimization CPLEX Modeling for Python, also known as DOcplex. DOcplex is a library composed of two modules:

- Mathematical Programming Modeling for Python using docplex.mp (DOcplex.MP)
- Constraint Programming Modeling for Python using docplex.cp (DOcplex.CP)
